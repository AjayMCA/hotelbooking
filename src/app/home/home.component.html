              In these low-demand times, every reservation counts. Just making hotel direct booking easy from
               a technical perspective is not enough. If you want to increase conversion, you need to convince
                hesitant customers and make sure that no potential customer leaves your website without booking.
                This article will give you practical ideas and examples of how smart hotels leverage human common
                 sense and some artificial intelligence (i.e. chatbots) to increase their direct conversion rate.
